# Checkout Order Total Kata

This is my submission for the coding test portion of the Accenture interview process.

It solves the Checkout Order Total Kata that is defined here: https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-checkout-order-total

## Prerequisites

In order to run this code, you will need:

  - Version 14 or higher of Node.js (This project was developed using v14.16.0.)
  - npm installed (This should be installed automatically as part of the node.js installation.)

  The most recent LTS version of Node.js can be installed from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Initial Set-up

Before running the code or the tests, make sure that you are connected to the internet, navigate to the directory that contains the package.json file, and run the command:

```bash
npm i
```

This will download and install dependencies from the remote _npm_ registry.

## Running the program

To run the code, navigate to the directory that contains the package.json file, and run the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Note: This repository only contains the library code- running ```npm start``` will simply execute index.js. I have included some basic examples of how this code could be used in that file.

## Unit Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the directory that contains the package.json file, and run the command:

```bash
npm test
```

To see a code coverage report, navigate to the directory that contains the package.json file, and run the command:

```bash
npm run coverage
```
